You are given an array of integers. Print the frequency of each element in the array.

Sample Input:

3 6 2 1 7 3 7 4 1 7 4

Sample Output:

3 2

6 1

2 1

1 2

7 3

4 2

Explanation: 3 appears twice, but we have to print its frequency only once. Same is with other numbers.



function printFrequency(arr) {
    let frequency = {};

    // Count frequency of each element
    arr.forEach(num => {
        frequency[num] = (frequency[num] || 0) + 1;
    });

    // Print the frequencies
    for (let key in frequency) {
        console.log(key, frequency[key]);
    }
}

// Sample Input
let arr = [3, 6, 2, 1, 7, 3, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4];

printFrequency(arr);
