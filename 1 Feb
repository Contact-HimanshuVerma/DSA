Print the following pattern based on the given input.

Sample Input:

5

Sample Output:

*

Explanation: Since the input is 5, it prints a total of 5 lines of stars. Each line has stars as well as leading spaces. In each line, the star count increases by 2, but the leading space decreases by 1.


function starPattern (n) {
  let star = *;
  let space = " ";
  
  for ( let i = 1; i <= n; i++ ) {
    console.log(space.repeat(n-i)) + star.repeat((i*2)-1));
  }
}
