Minimum in an Array âœ…

You are given an integer array. Find the minimum element of the array.

Sample Input:

10 5 6 3 4 3 5 6

Sample Output:

3

Explanation: Here 3 is the minimum number. But since 3 is present more than once, we print the index of the first occurrence.


function minNum(arr) {
  let minN = arr[0];
  let minIndex = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < minN) {
      minN = arr[i];
      minIndex = i;
    }
  }

  return [minN, minIndex];
}
