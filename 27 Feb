Sum of All Differences Between Pairs
You are given an array of integers. Calculate the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of numbers in the array.

Sample Input:

7 3 6 4

Sample Output:

14

Explanation:

Absolute difference between 7 and 3 = 4

Absolute difference between 7 and 6 = 1

Absolute difference between 7 and 4 = 3

Absolute difference between 3 and 6 = 3

Absolute difference between 3 and 4 = 1

Absolute difference between 6 and 4 = 2

Sum of absolute differences between all pairs: 4+1+3+3+1+2 = 14



function diffBwPair ( arr ) {
  let sum = 0;
  
  for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
    for ( let j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++ ) {
      sum += Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
