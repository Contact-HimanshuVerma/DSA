Is Perfect Number?: âœ…
You are given an integer n. Print yes, if it is a Perfect Number. Print no, if it is not a Perfect Number.
A Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
Sample Input 1:
28
Sample Output 1:
Yes
Explanation 1: The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. We don't consider the number itself. 28 = 1+2+4+7+14.
Sample Input 2:
24
Sample Output 2:
No
Explanation 2: The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. We don't consider the number itself. But 24 != 1+2+3+4+6+8+12.


function isPerfectNumber(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return "No";
    }

    // Calculate the sum of divisors excluding the number itself
    let divisorSum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            divisorSum += i;
        }
    }

    return divisorSum === n ? "Yes" : "No";
}

// Test cases
console.log(isPerfectNumber(28)); // Output: Yes
console.log(isPerfectNumber(24)); // Output: No
