12

Explanation: 5+7 = 12 is the maximum sum of two consecutive integers in the given array.



function findMaxNum ( arr ) {
  let maxSum = arr[0] + arr[1];

  
  for ( let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
    if ( arr[i-1] + arr[i] > maxSum ) {
      maxSum = arr[i-1] + arr[i];
    } 
  }
  return maxSum;
}
