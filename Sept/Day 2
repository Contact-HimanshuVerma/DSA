Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and checks whether it is a prime number using a while loop. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.



For example:

5 is prime because it can only be divided by 1 and 5.

6 is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6.





Constraints:

Use only a while loop for repetition.

Do not use for loop or any functions.

The input integer n will always be a positive integer.



Sample Input 1:
5



Sample Output 1:
Prime Number



Sample Input 2:
6



Sample Output 2:
Not a Prime Number


//Phython Code

n = int(input())
i = 2
is_prime = True

while i<n:
 if n%i == 0:
  is_prime = False
 i=i+1

if is_prime :
  print("Prime Number")
else:
 print("Not a Prime Number")

if n==1:
  print("Not a Prime Number")
