Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes an integer n as input and prints a pyramid pattern with numbers. The pyramid should have n rows, where the first row contains the number 1, the second row contains 1 2, the third row contains 1 2 3, and so on, until the nth row.





Constraints:

Use only while loop for repetition.

Do not use for loop or any functions.

Input will always be a positive integer.



Sample Input 1:
5



Sample Output 1:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5



Sample Input 2:
3



Sample Output 2:
1
1 2
1 2 3




n = int(input())
i = 1
while i <= n:
  j = 1
  while j<i:
    print(j, end=" ")
    j = j + 1
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
