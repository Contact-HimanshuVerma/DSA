Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and calculates its factorial using a while loop. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (i.e., n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1).





Constraints:

Use only while loop for repetition.

Do not use for loop or any functions.

Input will always be a positive integer.



Sample Input 1:
5



Sample Output 1:
120



Sample Input 2:
3



Sample Output 2:
6


i = 1
n = int(input())
fact = 1
while i<=n:
  fact=fact*i
  i=i+1
print(fact)
