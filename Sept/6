Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes two integers, start and end, as input and counts how many prime numbers exist between start and end (inclusive) using a while loop.





Constraints:

Use only while loop for repetition.

Do not use any inbuilt functions or methods.

Input will always be positive integers, with start â‰¤ end.



Explanation:
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). In this problem, you need to check each number in the given range and determine if it is prime.



Sample Input 1:
10
20



Sample Output 1:
4
(Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 20 are: 11, 13, 17, and 19.)



Sample Input 2:
1
10



Sample Output 2:
4
(Explanation: The prime numbers between 1 and 10 are: 2, 3, 5, and 7.)



n = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
count = 0
if n ==1:
  n = n + 1 
while n <= num2:  
  i = 2
  is_prime = True
  while i<n:
   if n%i == 0:
    is_prime = False
   i=i+1
  if is_prime:
    count = count + 1
    # print(n, end=" ")
  n = n + 1
print(count)
