Problem Statement:
Write a program that generates a series starting from 3 and continues by adding 2 to each subsequent number. The program should print the first n numbers of the series using a while loop.

For example, the series starts like: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ....





Constraints:

Use only a while loop for repetition.

Do not use for loop or any functions.

The input n will always be a positive integer.



Sample Input 1:
5



Sample Output 1:
3 5 7 9 11



Sample Input 2:
3



Sample Output 2:
3 5 7

n = int(input())

i = 0
sum = 1
while i < n:
  sum = sum + 2
  print(sum, end=" ")
  i = i + 1
