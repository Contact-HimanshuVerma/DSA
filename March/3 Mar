Given two strings s1 and s2 consisting of lowercase characters, the task is to check whether the two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.

Examples:

Input: s1 = “geeks”  s2 = “kseeg”
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string have same characters with same frequency. So, they are anagrams.

Input: s1 = “allergy”  s2 = “allergic”
Output: false
Explanation: Characters in both the strings are not same. s1 has extra character 'y' and s2 has extra characters 'i' and 'c', so they are not anagrams.

Input: s1 = "g", s2 = "g"
Output: true
Explanation: Characters in both the strings are same, so they are anagrams.


function areAnagrams(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length !== s2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const charCount = {};
    
    for (let char of s1) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    for (let char of s2) {
        if (!charCount[char]) {
            return false;
        }
        charCount[char]--;
    }    
    return true;
}

// Test cases
console.log(areAnagrams("geeks", "kseeg")); // true
console.log(areAnagrams("allergy", "allergic")); // false
console.log(areAnagrams("g", "g")); // true
console.log(areAnagrams("gnng", "gnng")); // true
