Min and Max Difference in an Array:
You are given an array of integers. Find the minimum and maximum difference between any two elements in an array.

Sample Input:

5 4 7 8 4 6 11 9

Sample Output:

0 7

Explanation: Minimum Difference: 4 - 4 = 0. Maximum Difference: 11 - 4 = 7


function minAndMaxDiff(arr) {
  let minDiff = Infinity;
  let maxDiff = -Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      let diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
      if (diff < minDiff) {
        minDiff = diff;
      }
      if (diff > maxDiff) {
        maxDiff = diff;
      }
    }
  }

  return `Minimum Difference is ${minDiff}, Maximum Difference is ${maxDiff}`;
}

// Example usage
let arr = [3, 1, 9, 5];
console.log(minAndMaxDiff(arr)); // Expected output: "Minimum Difference is 0, Maximum Difference is 8"
